<h1>Quick water info</h1>
<p>People use water every day for many different things. 3% of water is fresh water and the other 97% is salt water. Water is also used by animals and plants</p>
<h1>Water Pollution</h1>
<h2>About water pollution</h2>
<p>Water pollution is bad. Almost 60% of species live in water. Meaning if all the water was polluted, Everything would end up dieing.</p>
<h2>Cause and effect of water pollution</h2>
<p>Water pollution is caused by different things. One thing is because of the industrial wastes dumped into the rivers and other bodies of water. 
This will cause an imbalance in the water leading to severe contamination and death of aquatic species. <b>Including fish</b> which people eat so it will end up killing more than aquatic species.</p>
<p>Another thing is spraying insecticides and pesticides on plants because it pollutes the ground water system. A third thing is oil spills in the oceans. They cause irreparable damage to the water bodies. 

<h1>Water Footprint</h1>
<h2>What is a water footprint</h2>
<p>A water footprint shows the extent of water use in relation to consumption by people.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_footprint)</p>
<p>Here is a list of how much water is needed for certain things.</p>
<ul>
<li>450 Litres for one cob of corn</li>
<li>900 Litres for one pound of soybeans</li>
<li>1170 Litres for one chicken</li>
<li>1700 Litres for one package of rice</li>
<li>2500 Litres for one big piece of cheese</li>
<li>4500 Litres for one steak of beef</li>
</ul>
<p>Found from(https://ecosistemaurbano.org/wp-content/uploads/virtualwater_alimentos1.gif)</p>
<p>So yah lots of water for daily things you eat.<p>

<h2>Easy things</h2>
<p>If you want to start helping but don't know what, here is a list of easy tasks you can do to save water.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't leave tap on while brushing teeth</li>
<li>Take showers instead of baths but don't make it a long shower.</li>
<li>Don't always buy new clothes, you can try buying used ones</li>
<li>Compost your eaten fruits and vegtables. Don't through them in the garbage.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have probably heard about some of these things before.</p>
<p>You can do some research if you would want to do more.</p>
<h2>My idea(which isn't really possible)</h2>
<p>So as I said before 3% of water is fresh water. But why just use 3%, why not the other 97%?. Yes, it's salt water but people can just extract the salt. Than you got more fresh water and salt. So now there is no need for mining salt.</p>
<p>But this idea requires a lot of energy. So for this to be possible, powerful <b>renewable</b> energy would have to exist.</p>
<p>Yah. Not really possible but I was just thinking.</p>
