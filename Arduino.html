			<h1> What is Arduino</h1>
			<p>Arduino is a programmable computer. But it is just a board.</p>
			<p>The arduino is usually used for elecrtical circuits so it would be good for circuit programming.</p>
			<p>In this tutorial you will learn about how to make circuits and much more. But you will need some parts.</p>
			<section>
				<h2>The parts</h2>
				
				<p>Before you do anything you're going to need some parts.</p>
				<p>First you may want to get an Arduino kit.</p>
				<p>It is much easyer that getting all of the parts seperate.</p>
				<p>Here is a list of other parts you may need.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Some motors</li>
					<li>A speaker</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>The software</h2>
				<p>You are going to need the Arduino software for programming.</p>
				<p>You can go to the download page on the Arduino website by clicking that Arduino image 6 times.</p>
				<p>Or if it doesn't work. You can click on the link <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">here</a>.</p>
				<p>Remember to get the version for your computer. If you have Windows 32 or 64 bit get the download for that. Or if you have a Mac get the one for Mac.</p>
				<p>Once you have done all of that. It is time to start making stuff.</p>
